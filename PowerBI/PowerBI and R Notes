LAK Exchange Rate Forecasting & Analysis Dashboard

-Project Overview:
This dashboard delivers a comprehensive time series and predictive analysis of the LAK (Lao Kip) exchange rate using data from a historical API.
The dashboard includes linear regression, volatility tracking, regime identification, time series decomposition, predictive modeling (Random Forest), 
and a 30-day forecast using the Prophet model. It is designed to support decision-making in financial strategy, FX exposure planning, and risk management.

-Key Objectives:
Monitor the LAK exchange rate and identify patterns over time
Detect periods of volatility and regime shifts
Model and predict future exchange rate behavior
Forecast exchange rate movements with confidence intervals

Key Dashboard Components:


-Linear Regression with Outlier Detection:
Highlights the general direction of LAK over time using linear regression.
Influential points identified using Cook's Distance.
Interpretation: A downward trend was observed with several impactful outliers in late January and March.

-Rolling 7-Day Volatility Plot:
Shows fluctuations in volatility using a 7-day rolling standard deviation.
Interpretation: Significant spikes were observed in February, suggesting sudden market shocks.

-Time Series Decomposition:
Breakdown of the exchange rate into: Trend, Seasonal, and Remainder (noise).
Interpretation:
Trend: A long-term decrease followed by recovery in March.
Seasonality: A strong, repeating weekly pattern, especially a drop on Mondays.
Remainder: Captures random fluctuations and outliers.

-Predictive Modeling (Random Forest):
Predicts the exchange rate using historical lag features and rolling statistics.
Interpretation: The model accurately captures the structure of the data and closely follows the actual values, even during high volatility.

-Prophet Forecast (30 Days):
Forecast generated using the Prophet model.
Components include future trend and weekly seasonality.
Interpretation:
Trend: Forecast shows continued strengthening of the LAK through April.
Seasonality: Consistent pattern with Monday dips and midweek peaks.


-Insights & Business Value:
Exchange rate fluctuations are not random; structured volatility and seasonality can be leveraged.
Outlier detection and volatility plots provide actionable insights for risk management.
Predictive modeling and Prophet forecasts offer reliable tools for planning remittance cycles, FX hedging, and monetary policy analysis.

-Recommendations:
Operational Planning: Avoid FX transactions on Mondays where possible due to consistent dips.
Monitoring Regimes: Implement alerts during volatility spikes (e.g., >500 std dev) to evaluate macroeconomic causes.
Model Extensions: Integrate macroeconomic indicators (interest rate changes, inflation, policy events) as external regressors for future Prophet models.
Currency Comparison: Expand model to include DKK, EUR, and other regional currencies to understand cross-currency volatility regimes.

-Technical Stack:
Power BI Desktop
R Scripts: ggplot2, prophet, dplyr, randomForest, zoo, changepoint
Data Sources: API ingestion, structured CSV history
