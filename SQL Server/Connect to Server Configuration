To facilitate seamless user access to the SQL Server from Power BI over the network, several critical configurations and tests were performed to ensure connectivity,
  security, and disaster recovery readiness.

SQL Server Configuration for Network Access

Enabling TCP/IP Protocol:
  The SQL Server instance was configured to allow network connectivity by enabling the TCP/IP protocol through the SQL Server Configuration Manager. 
    This ensures SQL Server is accessible over the network using the standard port for SQL connections (1433).

User Authentication Setup:
  SQL Server Authentication was implemented to provide access credentials for Power BI users. Dedicated SQL Server logins and profiles were created with appropriate roles and permissions (e.g., db_datareader for read-only access).
  As this setup was conducted in a WORKGROUP environment (without Active Directory integration), all authentication was configured using SQL Server’s internal security model.

Firewall Configuration:
  The server’s Windows Defender Firewall was updated to allow SQL Server network traffic:
  TCP port 1433 was opened to enable SQL Server connections.
  UDP port 1434 was opened to facilitate SQL Server Browser service, enabling named instance discovery.
  These changes were applied to the relevant profiles (Domain, Private, Public) to support both direct connections and discovery of named instances.

Connectivity Verification:
  Connection testing was performed using Windows PowerShell’s Test-NetConnection command, validating that the required ports (1433 for SQL Server and 1434 for SQL Server Browser) were open and accessible on the network.
  Additionally, the server’s hostname and IP resolution were confirmed to ensure reliable access.

Power BI Integration:
  Power BI Desktop was configured to connect to the SQL Server using the assigned SQL Server authentication credentials.
  The connection utilized the hostname and explicitly specified the SQL Server instance (if named) to ensure accurate resolution and data retrieval.
  The connection was tested and verified, with Power BI successfully querying data from the SQL Server.

Disaster Recovery Configuration:
  Veeam Backup & Replication was installed and configured to provide local backup capabilities for the SQL Server and associated system files.
  Regular backups were scheduled to support simple disaster recovery scenarios, ensuring the SQL Server environment can be quickly restored in the event of 
    hardware failure, data corruption, or other operational disruptions.
  Backup integrity and recovery processes were validated to confirm readiness.


Summary:
  This comprehensive configuration ensures secure, reliable, and efficient connectivity between Power BI and SQL Server in a WORKGROUP-based network environment. 
    By enabling TCP/IP, configuring authentication, and opening the necessary firewall ports, users can now access SQL Server data with confidence. 
    Additionally, the implementation of a robust local backup strategy enhances the overall reliability and disaster recovery capabilities of the environment.
